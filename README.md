## 🧪 About Me

I am an Environmental Scientist currently pursuing my MSc in Environmental Science at **Nankai University**, China, with a CGPA of **3.71/4.0**. My work focuses on developing **plant-based remediation systems** to remove **emerging pollutants** from contaminated environments. I combine lab research, meta-analysis, and field trials to innovate sustainable solutions for soil and water pollution.

I am currently looking for fully funded **PhD positions** in Environmental Science, with research interests in:

- Phytoremediation & Bioremediation  
- Emerging Contaminants (Microplastics, Pharmaceuticals, Heavy Metals)  
- Rhizosphere Ecology & Plant-Microbe Interactions  
- Omics for Environmental Toxicology

## 🧑‍🔬 Work Experience

### 🔬 Research Assistant (Sep 2023 – Jun 2026)  
**The key laboratory of pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria, Nankai University, China**  
- Conducting lab/field studies on bioremediation & phytoremediation of soil/water pollutants (heavy metals, organics, emerging
contaminants).
- Optimizing experiments to assess impacts of environmental factors (pH, temperature, elevated CO2, light microbial activity) on remediation efficiency.
- Analyzing pollutants using HPLC, GC-MS, ICP-MS, FTIR, and other analytical techniques.
- Performing meta-analysis/systematic reviews to evaluate global remediation trends.
- Managing lab safety, sample preparation, and QA/QC protocols for experiments.
- Assisting in field sampling and pilot-scale trials at contaminated sites.
- Publishing research in peer-reviewed journals.

### 💧 Project Officer – Freshwater Programme (Feb 2023 – May 2023)  
**WWF Pakistan**  
- Spearheaded the installation and monitoring of sustainable water solutions, including Floating Treatment Wetlands, Rainwater
Harvesting Systems, Ablution Water Reuse Systems, and Drinking Water Filtration Plants, ensuring efficient water resource
management.
- Oversaw procurement of field materials to support project implementation while adhering to budgetary and sustainability
guidelines.
- Developed engaging presentations and infographics to enhance project visibility and stakeholder engagement.
- Prepared comprehensive reports in compliance with organizational and donor standards, ensuring accurate documentation of
progress and impact.
- Maintained meticulous records of water replenishment targets, tracking monthly performance metrics to align with conservation
goals.

## 📚 Publications (Under Review)

- **Research progress of using ornamental plants to cope approach environmental pollutants, a breakthrough of
bioremediation technology - A Review Paper**  
  *This review paper explores ornamental plants as sustainable tools for phytoremediation, effectively removing pollutants from soil,
water, and air without entering the food chain. It highlights their physiological and molecular mechanisms for pollutant tolerance
and uptake, along with ecological benefits like urban biodiversity enhancement and socio-economic advantages such as green jobs
and commercial by-products. Key challenges include optimizing stress resistance, leveraging plant-microbe interactions, and
managing biomass. Additionally, these plants support carbon neutrality by sequestering CO₂ while detoxifying contaminants,
positioning them as vital for climate-smart remediation strategies.*
**Authors**: **Rizwan Ali**, Jianv Liu*, Gao Minghao, Jiayin Gao and Li Yun

- **Joint Omics Analysis to Reveal the Tolerance Mechanisms of Mirabilis Jalapa L. To Cd and Tph Pollution Under Elevated CO2**  
  *This study examines how Mirabilis jalapa L. removes cadmium (Cd) and total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) under normal and
elevated CO₂ conditions. It identifies key defense-related genes and functional pathways under combined Cd, TPH, and high CO₂
stress while uncovering adaptive molecular mechanisms using metagenomic and transcriptomic analyses.*
**Authors**:  Jianv Liu*, Yufang Xiao, Qinyuan Mei, Minghao Gao, Yun Li and **Rizwan Ali**

- **High atmospheric CO2 rather than microplastic directly affects ecological response of submerged plant systems in
eutrophic water**
