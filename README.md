## 🧪 About Me

I am an Environmental Scientist currently pursuing my MSc in Environmental Science at **Nankai University**, China, with a CGPA of **3.71/4.0**. My work focuses on developing **plant-based remediation systems** to remove **emerging pollutants** from contaminated environments. I combine lab research, meta-analysis, and field trials to innovate sustainable solutions for soil and water pollution.

I am currently looking for fully funded **PhD positions** in Environmental Science, with research interests in:

- Phytoremediation & Bioremediation  
- Emerging Contaminants (Microplastics, Pharmaceuticals, Heavy Metals)  
- Rhizosphere Ecology & Plant-Microbe Interactions  
- Environmental Modeling & Risk Assessment  
- Omics for Environmental Toxicology
